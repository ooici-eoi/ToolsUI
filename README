These are NetBeans projects for running ToolsUI and TDS.

Since the NetCDF-Java libraries moved to Maven, this process has gotten much easier.

Clone this repository:
]$ git clone git@github.com:asascience/ToolsUI.git
]$ cd ToolsUI

Initialize the submodule (THREDDS)
]$ git submodule update

You must install Apache Maven (tested with 2.2.1) to procede.  Once it is installed:
]$ cd THREDDS
]$ mvn install

Watch the text fly by...

When that completes, load the following projects into NetBeans:
* Maven project ./ToolsUI/THREDDS/
* NetBeans project ./ToolsUI/TDS project
* NetBeans project ./ToolsUI/ToolsUI project

Edit the TDS project properties (right click on the TDS project... left click Properties)

Remove all "Source Package Folders" references and add the following folders (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/tds/src/main/java

Remove all "Test Package Folders" references and add the following folders (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/tds/src/test/java

Press OK to close the dialog


Edit the ToolsUI project properties (right click on the ToolsUI project... left click Properties)

Remove all "Source Package Folders" references and add the following folders (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/ui/src/main/java
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/ui/src/main/resources

Press OK to close the dialog


Once NetBeans finishes scanning projects and whatever else it does after you change the project settings...

Both TDS and ToolsUI should now Build and Run!
