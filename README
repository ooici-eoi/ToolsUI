These are NetBeans projects for running ToolsUI and THREDDS.
It also contains projects for the Java-OPeNDAP libraries as well as the NetCDF-Java libraries

How to get setup?

Clone this repository:
git clone git@github.com:asascience/ToolsUI.git

Initialize the submodules (Java-OPeNDAP and THREDDS)
git submodule update

Load the three projects into NetBeans:
netcdf-4.x
opendap-2.2
toolsUI-4.x
tds-4.x


Getting opendap-2.2 to build:

Edit the opendap-2.2 project properties (right click on project... Properties)
Under Sources, remove all references and add the following folders (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/Java-OPeNDAP/src/opendap

You should not have to alter the libraries, they are hopefully
referenced relatively.

opendap-2.2 should now build correctly!



Getting netcdf-4.x to build:

Download jpeg2000.jar and move it to (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/lib/external/

Edit the netcdf-4.x project properties (right click on project... Properties)
Under Sources, remove all references and add the following folders (your absolute path to the ToolsUI folder may be different):
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/common/src/java
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/cdm/src/main/java
/foo/bar/ToolsUI/THREDDS/cdm/src/main/resources

You should not have to alter the libraries, they are hopefully
referenced relatively.

netcdf-4.x should now build correctly!
